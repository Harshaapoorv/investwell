This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install all the dependencies

Run the below command in the root directory of the project to install all the packages required

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: (For iOS) Install the pod file

```bash
pod install
```

## Step 3: Build the application

First you will need to build the app by using the commands given below with respect to the device

```bash
# Android
npm run build:android

# iOS
npm run build:ios
```

## Step 4: Run your application

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

#### Now the app is running successfully, you will be able to see a landing page where you can see an input field for Pan number
